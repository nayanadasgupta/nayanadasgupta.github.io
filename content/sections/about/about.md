Hello! My name is Nayana and I'm a Software Engineer at Twilio who loves all things code. I have a deep passion for building functional and performant products, with great user experiences and can often be found tinkering with various personal projects and experimenting with new technologies.

I recently graduated with an MEng in Computer Science with First Class Honours from UCL, with my dissertation investigating how we can apply social mechanisms to multi-agent systems to enable the emergence of cooperation within groups of AI agents. 

Outside of work, I love reading, playing board games and going on long walks.

Here are a few technologies I've worked with recently:

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- Python
